# Module 3: Keras Deep Learning Essentials

This module introduces core components of deep learning using Keras. We focus on building and training neural networks with custom configurations of activation functions, optimizers, and evaluation metrics. You'll gain hands-on experience constructing models, compiling them with various optimizers, and analyzing performance using built-in metrics.
