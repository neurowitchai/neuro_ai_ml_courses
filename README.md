# üß† neuroai_courses

This repository contains projects, notes, and exercises from various online courses I'm taking to deepen my understanding of NeuroAI, deep learning, and neural networks. The focus is on applying foundational machine learning principles to neuroscience-inspired AI systems and building a strong theoretical and practical base for advanced work in the field.
