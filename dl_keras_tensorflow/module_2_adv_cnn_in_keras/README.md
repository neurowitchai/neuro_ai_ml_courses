* Using advanced techniques to develop convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using Keras can enhance deep learning models and significantly improve performance on complete tasks.
* Incorporating various data augmentation techniques using Keras can improve the performance and generalization ability of models.
* Transfer learning using pre-trained models in Keras improves training time and performance.
* Pre-trained models in Keras allow you to build high-performing models even with limited computational resources and data.
* Transfer learning involves fine tuning of pre-trained models when you do not have enough data to train a deep-learning model. 
* Fine tuning pre-trained models allows you to adapt the model to a specific task, leading to even better performance.
* TensorFlow is a powerful library that enables image manipulation tasks, such as classification, data augmentations, and more advanced techniques.
* TensorFlowâ€™s high-level APIs simplify the implementation of complete image-processing tasks.
* Transpose convolution is helpful in image generation, super-resolution, and semantic segmentation applications.
* It performs the inverse convolution operation, effectively up-sampling the input image to a larger higher resolution size.
* It works by inserting zeros between elements of the input feature map and then applying the convolution operation.
